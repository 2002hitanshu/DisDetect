# DisDetect
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder with onset in early childhood that is associated with a wide range of symptoms and ability levels. Although no cure exists for autism spectrum disorder, and there is no one-size-fits-all treatment. The only treatment is to maximize your child's ability to function by reducing autism spectrum disorder symptoms and supporting development and learning. In this project we are going to detect autism disease by analysing images to make such a model which will help two determine ASD and help people gain confidence in their recovery rate.

Objectives of the project:
1.	Develop a classification model: Create an AI-based system to classify user responses as indicative of a specific learning disability or not.
2.	Design an interactive chatbot: Use conversational AI to collect user input in a natural and accessible manner.
3.	Train and evaluate AI models: Utilize NLP algorithms and machine learning techniques to ensure high diagnostic accuracy.
4.	Ensure accessibility: Incorporate multilingual support and voice assistance to cater to diverse users.
5.	Provide actionable insights: Deliver diagnostic suggestions, educational resources, and next steps for users based on the results.
6.	Maintain data security and scalability: Implement robust cybersecurity measures and deploy the system on a scalable cloud platform to handle high user volumes.

Conclusion:
The project on the Learning Disability Detection Platform was an enriching experience that contributed significantly to my professional growth. The project objectives were successfully achieved, including the development of an AI-powered diagnostic chatbot and the deployment of a secure and scalable platform. This experience not only honed my technical skills but also deepened my understanding of the importance of accessibility and innovation in addressing societal challenges. The knowledge and skills gained during this internship will undoubtedly benefit my future endeavors
